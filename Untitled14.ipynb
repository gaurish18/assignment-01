    "1.In computer programming, a tuple is an ordered collection of elements, often of different types. Tuples are typically\n",
    "represented as sequences, where each element is positioned at a specific index. Here are the main characteristics of tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Ordered: The elements in a tuple are ordered, meaning that each element has a specific position or index within \n",
    "       the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Heterogeneous: Tuples can contain elements of different types. For example, a tuple could include a string,\n",
    "       an integer, and a boolean value all in the same tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Immutable: Tuples are generally immutable, which means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified. \n",
    "       You cannot add, remove, or change individual elements within a tuple. However, it's important to note that if an\n",
    "        element within a tuple is mutable (e.g., a list), it can be modified, but the tuple itself remains immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Fixed Size: Tuples have a fixed size, meaning that you cannot add or remove elements once the tuple is created. \n",
    "       To modify a tuple, you need to create a new tuple with the desired elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are commonly used when you want to group related data together in a structure that should not be modified after\n",
    "creation, such as returning multiple values from a function or representing coordinates (x, y) in a 2D plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.In Python, tuples have two built-in methods: `count()` and `index()`. Here's an explanation and example of each method:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. `count()`: The `count()` method returns the number of occurrences of a specified element in a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example;\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2)\n",
    "count = my_tuple.count(2)\n",
    "print(count)  # Output: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the `count()` method is used to determine how many times the element `2` appears in the tuple `my_tuple.`\n",
    "The method returns the count, which is `3` in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. `index()`: The `index()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified element in a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)\n",
    "index = my_tuple.index(30)\n",
    "print(index)  # Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the `index()` method is used to find the index of the element `30` in the tuple `my_tuple`.\n",
    "The method returns the index, which is `2` in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's discuss why tuples have only these two built-in methods compared to lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Immutability: Tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified after creation. Since tuples are designed to be\n",
    "static, there is no need for methods like `append()`, `insert()`, or `remove()`, which are available in lists and used \n",
    "to modify their contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Simplicity: Tuples are intended to be simple data structures for grouping related elements. The limited number of\n",
    "methods keeps the tuple interface clean and straightforward, making tuples lightweight and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "By having only the essential methods, tuples remain focused on their core purpose of storing and accessing data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.In Python, the collection data type that does not allow duplicate items is a set. Sets are unordered collections of\n",
    "unique elements. To remove duplicates from the given list using a set, you can convert the list to a set, and then convert\n",
    "it back to a list if needed. Here's an example code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 4]\n",
    "unique_list = list(set(my_list))\n",
    "\n",
    "print(unique_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above, the `set()` function is used to convert the list `my_list` to a set, which automatically removes the\n",
    "duplicate elements. Then, the `list()` function is used to convert the set back to a list. The resulting list `unique_list`\n",
    "contains only the unique elements from the original list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that sets are unordered, so the order of elements in `unique_list` may differ from the original list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Both `union()` and `update()` are methods available for sets in Python, but they differ in their behavior.\n",
    "Here's an explanation of each method along with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `union()` method:\n",
    "   - The `union()` method returns a new set that contains all the unique elements from both sets involved in the operation.\n",
    "   - It does not modify the original sets; instead, it creates a new set.\n",
    "   - The `union()` method can also be achieved using the `|` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "set1 = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "set2 = {3, 4, 5}\n",
    "union_set = set1.union(set2)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, `union_set` is a new set created by performing the union operation on `set1` and `set2`.\n",
    "It contains all the unique elements from both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `update()` method:\n",
    "   - The `update()` method modifies the original set by adding all the elements from another iterable \n",
    "     (such as a set, list, or tuple) to it.\n",
    "   - It mutates the set in-place rather than creating a new set.\n",
    "   - The `update()` method can also be achieved using the `|=` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "other_set = {3, 4, 5}\n",
    "my_set.update(other_set)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, `my_set` is modified by adding all the elements from `other_set` using the `update()` method.\n",
    "After the update, `my_set` contains all the unique elements from both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the `union()` method returns a new set containing the union of two sets without modifying the original \n",
    "sets, while the `update()` method modifies the original set by adding elements from another iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5.In Python, a dictionary is a collection data type that stores key-value pairs. It is also known as an associative\n",
    "array or hash map. Each key in a dictionary is unique and used to access its corresponding value. Dictionaries are \n",
    "enclosed in curly braces `{}`, and key-value pairs are separated by a colon `:`. Here's an example of a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, `my_dict` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs.\n",
    "The keys are `\"name\"`, `\"age\"`, and `\"city\"`, and their corresponding values are `\"John\"`, `30`, and `\"New York\"`, \n",
    "respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries in Python are unordered. Prior to Python 3.7, the order of items in a dictionary was arbitrary and not guaranteed.\n",
    "However, starting from Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain the order of insertion, meaning that the order of items \n",
    "is preserved when iterating over the dictionary or accessing its keys, values, or items. In other words, in Python 3.7 \n",
    "and later versions, dictionaries are considered ordered dictionaries. To have a specifically ordered dictionary,\n",
    "you can use the `collections.OrderedDict` class from the Python standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Yes, we can create a nested dictionary in Python. A nested dictionary is a dictionary where the values can themselves\n",
    "be dictionaries. This allows for a hierarchical structure where each value is associated with another dictionary.\n",
    "Here's an example of a simple one-level nested dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "employee_details = {\"John\": {\"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"},\n",
    "                    \"Alice\": {\"age\": 25, \"city\": \"London\"},\n",
    "                    \"Bob\": {\"age\": 35, \"city\": \"Paris\"}}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we have a dictionary named `employee_details` where the keys are employee names, and the values\n",
    "are dictionaries containing additional details about each employee. Each nested dictionary represents the details of \n",
    "an employee, with keys like `\"age\"` and `\"city\"` and their respective values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access specific information from the nested dictionary, you can use multiple indexing or chaining of keys. \n",
    "For example;\n",
    "print(employee_details[\"John\"][\"age\"])   # Output: 30\n",
    "print(employee_details[\"Alice\"][\"city\"]) # Output: London\n",
    "print(employee_details[\"Bob\"][\"age\"])    # Output: 35\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code snippet above, we access specific values from the nested dictionary by providing the respective keys. \n",
    "For instance, `employee_details[\"John\"][\"age\"]` retrieves the age of the employee named \"John\" from the nested dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7.To add a key named \"topics\" with the value ['Python', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning'] to the given dictionary \n",
    "using the `setdefault()` method, you can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "dict1 = {'language': 'Python', 'course': 'Data Science Masters'}\n",
    "dict1.setdefault('topics', ['Python', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning'])\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dict1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "{'language': 'Python', 'course': 'Data Science Masters', 'topics': ['Python', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning']}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above, `setdefault('topics', ['Python', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning'])` is used to add a new key-value \n",
    "pair to the `dict1` dictionary. If the key 'topics' already exists, the existing value will be returned. Otherwise, the key \n",
    "'topics' will be added to the dictionary with the specified default value ['Python', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning'].\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing the code, you will see that the dictionary `dict1` now includes the 'topics' key with its corresponding\n",
    "value as the provided list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8.In Python, dictionaries have three view objects that provide dynamic views on the dictionary's keys, values,\n",
    "  and key-value pairs. These view objects are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `dict_keys`: This view object represents the keys of the dictionary.\n",
    "2. `dict_values`: This view object represents the values of the dictionary.\n",
    "3. `dict_items`: This view object represents the key-value pairs of the dictionary as tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates the use of the three in-built methods to display these view objects\n",
    "for the given dictionary `dict1`:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "dict1 = {'Sport': 'Cricket', 'Teams': ['India', 'Australia', 'England', 'South Africa', 'Sri Lanka', 'New Zealand']}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display dict_keys\n",
    "keys_view = dict1.keys()\n",
    "print(keys_view)  # Output: dict_keys(['Sport', 'Teams'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display dict_values\n",
    "values_view = dict1.values()\n",
    "print(values_view) \n",
    "# Output: dict_values(['Cricket', ['India', 'Australia', 'England', 'South Africa', 'Sri Lanka', 'New Zealand']])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display dict_items\n",
    "items_view = dict1.items()\n",
    "print(items_view) \n",
    "# Output: \n",
    "dict_items([('Sport', 'Cricket'), ('Teams', ['India', 'Australia', 'England', 'South Africa', 'Sri Lanka', 'New Zealand'])])\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above, `dict1.keys()` returns a `dict_keys` view object representing the keys of the dictionary,\n",
    "`dict1.values()` returns a `dict_values` view object representing the values, and `dict1.items()` returns a `dict_items` \n",
    "view object representing the key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The view objects are dynamic, meaning they reflect the changes made to the dictionary. If the dictionary\n",
    "is modified, the view objects will reflect those modifications."
